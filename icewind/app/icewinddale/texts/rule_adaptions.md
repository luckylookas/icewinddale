#The Adventure will be run on Cipher System + Optional Spellcasting rules with the following adaptions:

1. gritty resting:
    from [1 action, 10 minutes, 1 hour, 8 hours]
    to [1 action, 10 minutes, 1 hour, 8 hours, 24 hours]

2. gritty nutrition and sleep:
    if a PC does not eat or during 8 and 24 hour rests
    or does not sleep in a warm and reasonably dry place during 24 hour rests, they move one step up the damage track,
    which can only be healed by eating and sleeping.
    
3. gritty cold
    every 8 hours out in the cold, the PC have to tackle a might-defense roll depending on time spent and weather conditions.
    (2 + days sind the last warm bed + 1 for weather + (2-4 for blizzards etc))
    If the PC fails the task, they move one step up the damage track, which can only be healed by resting for 24 hours at 
    warm place.
    
4. gritty supplies
    a character can only ever carry 1 large , 2 medium and 4 small items with them 
    a bag is a medium item and can hold 1 medium and 8 small items
    
    1 large = 2 medium; 1 medium = 4 small
    
#Magic:
##Cantrips:

The optional spellcasting rules supply what are Cantrips in dnd.

##Spells
The more powerful Spells and Abilities are represented by ciphers.
Characters can learn Spells or Abilities from Scrolls, Books, Runes, Trainers and so on.
    
To prepare a Spell or Ability, the Character must spend effort and time.

    
What that preparation looks like is up to the Player, be creative and own your character:
    * A Wizard can wirte scrolls, tattoo magic runes into their arms
    * A Preist speaks prayers or performs rituals
    * A Warrior meditates, exercises or prepares their weapons
    * A Rogue brews poison or prepares smoke bombs

###creating ciphers

Creating a cipher is a task of pool matching your preparation technique, of difficulty {target cipher level} and takes the {target cipher level} of rests (during which you do not gain the benefits of resting) to do.
The PC can apply assets and effort to reduce the difficulty as by the normal rules.
They can also remove the longest rest slot by applying one point of effort, which can be done multiple times aswell.

so creating a level 6 cipher means:

task difficulty: 6
time required: 6 rests [ 1 action, 10 minutes, 1 hour, 8 hours, 24 hours, 1 action]

1 effort could reduce the difficulty to 11 or eliminate the 24 hour rest requirement.

failing the tasks consumes the time and effort spent, but yields no results.
There is no upper limit on the cipher levels a PC can target, the lower limit is the level the cipher from the book would have if you rolled a 0 on the d6 roll required

eg.:
"Age Taker" = 1d6+4, so it can be created as level 4 or higher.

## starting ciphers

Each PC knows {their cipher limit} ciphers from the rulebooks list from the start.
They can spend time preparing them in session zero.

## dropping ciphers

PC can decide to drop ciphers (loose them) any time without consequence.


## what ciphers are allowed for my character

If you choose to play as a Warrior and want to throw fireballs, do it.
Playing as mage would have gotten your there faster though.
